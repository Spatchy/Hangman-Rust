# What?
This is a version of the classic pen and paper game Hangman, made in Rust.

# Why?
I wanted a fun starter project to help me learn the basics of Rust. I could have made yet another todo list but that's boring.
At least with this project I could include some quirky dialog for the cpu character and some fun ASCII art.

# When?
The project took me total about 6 hours over the course of 5 or so days to complete, including some reading of the Rust Book.

# Where?
A large chunk of this was done on a train weirdly enough.

# Who?
Me, and only me. No AI was used at all in this project, not even for debugging. I wanted to learn things myself.
